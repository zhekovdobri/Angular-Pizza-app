    <p>Alexander's Pizza is associated with the Norwegian-American married couple Louis Jordan (born 1931) and Anne Jordan 
        (born 1944). He was an insurance agent, but had a desire to find a new livelihood when his family moved to Norway. 
        Anne Jordan suggested pizza because she thought the ingredients would suit the Norwegian taste.Louis Jordan took a 
        job at the pizza restaurant "Alexander's Pizzeria" in Hartford, Connecticut. There he used his time well and brought 
        with him important knowledge of American pizza. The knowledge and notes from the pizza restaurant were to form the 
        basis for the pizzas he would later launch in Norway. With $10,000 and American pizza recipes, after six months in 
        Norway, he started to realize his goal. His wife Anne followed up on the financial and legal obstacles they encountered
        along the way. They took over a room at Solli Plass in Oslo where Ben Youc√©f had started one of the first international 
        restaurants in Oslo. "Alexander's Pizza Pub", as the restaurant was first called, opened its doors for the first time in 
        May 1970.
